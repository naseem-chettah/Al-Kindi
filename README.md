# Al-Kindi
Al-Kindi Convertor is a simple app I wrote to help my classmates convert values in the numeric bases BIN, OCT, DEC and HEX. The use cases of this app are very limited so it's really just a simple application I write as a "Hello, World!" program to learn more about a new programming language/framework/library...

## Usage
### Required dependencies

Must be installed in order to use.
- python3-pyqt5

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/naseem-chettah/Al-Kindi.git"

sed 's/icos\\/icos\//g' Al-Kindi.py > Al-Kindi.py
python3 Al-Kindi.py
